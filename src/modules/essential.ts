const supportCrashMessage = `Alright, you'll need to provide a log for us to diagnose the cause of the crash. You can find instructions below on how to find the log.
If you're using a third party launcher, these instructions may not work and you'll have to consult a guide for that specific launcher.

**Windows:** Hit Windows Key + R and type in \`%appdata%\`. Open the \`.minecraft\` folder.
**Mac:** On the bar at the top of your screen in Finder, click \`Go\`, then click \`Go to Folder\` and type \`~/Library/Application Support/Minecraft\`, then hit enter.
**Linux:** \`.minecraft\` is located in your home folder. \`~/.minecraft\`

**If you used the Essential installer and chose to create a new profile, you'll need to open the \`essential_version\` folder (e.g. \`essential_1.17.1\`) in \`.minecraft\` before continuing**

Then proceed with navigating to the folder called \`logs\`. Inside that folder there is a file called \`latest\` or \`latest.log\`.

Once you have found this file, hit the green button below to continue or the red button to cancel.`;

- Versions (Minecraft version, Operating System version and if you can find it, Essential version)
- Steps to Reproduce (What do you need to do for the bug to happen?)
- Latest Log

When you're ready, hit the green button below to continue or the red button to cancel.`;

Firstly, you should check our [support page](<https://essential.gg/support>) to see if your question is answered there!

If our support page didn't answer your question, hit the green button below to continue or the red button to cancel.`;

const supportOtherMessage = `No worries! We can't list every possible issue.

Make sure you have all the details about the issue ready to provide to the support team.
While we're usually quick to respond, issues outside of the ones listed may take a bit more time to get an answer...
