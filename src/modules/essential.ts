If you're hosting the world, you'll need a decent PC and plenty of free RAM/CPU available for it to use. Checking these values while hosting and letting us know may help us help you.

Both players will also need a decent internet connection. If your connection isn't too stable, you may experience some issues such as falling into the void and timing out.
Lowering your render distance can sometimes help if you're timing out so give that a try!

If you're trying to play with a big modpack, it's important to note that some mods weren't designed to be used with Open to LAN (and therefore inviting friends with Esssential) so you may encounter isssues.

If the guide helped, you can click the red button below to cancel opening a ticket. Otherwise, click the green one to speak to our support team.`;

- Internet issues, such as a bad connection or a firewall blocking essential.gg
- An outage on our end (Check <#885509698575560724> to see if there's any known issues)
- A malicious application has tampered with your system preventing you from authenticating with Mojang

Our support team will guide you through troubleshooting the issue in your ticket.
